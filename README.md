# Spambot
A bot which will send the user inputted messages automatically for infinite times until the program is stopped

## How to use the program:
Open the **madlibs.ahk** file and you will be greeted by a dialogue box asking you to input the message that you want to spam
Next you will recieve another dialogue box asking the time interval between the messages; you can enter the values in seconds and if you dont want a delay, simply enter 0
If you finally have mercy on your friend/enemy, you can either press f5 to completely abort the program or press f6 to pause it and then resume it again later
